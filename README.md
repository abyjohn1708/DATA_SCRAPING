**Objective:**
The objective of the provided Python code is to extract key details from a sample text describing the BA History program at the London School of Economics (LSE). The code employs a combination of regular expressions, sentiment analysis, and data structuring techniques to efficiently locate, analyze, and organize specific information including degree type, application deadline, duration, admission requirements, overseas fees, and program description. The ultimate goal is to automate the extraction and storage of relevant program details in an Excel file, enhancing data processing capabilities for educational program information management.

**Detail Report:**

The provided Python code exemplifies a systematic approach to extracting and analyzing essential details from textual content related to the BA History program at LSE. Leveraging the power of regular expressions, the code efficiently locates specific pieces of information such as degree type, application deadline, duration, admission requirements, overseas fees, and program description embedded within the text.

Using sentiment analysis techniques provided by the TextBlob library, the code evaluates the sentiment polarity and subjectivity of the extracted text, providing insights into the overall tone and sentiment of the program description.

Furthermore, the code tokenizes the text and computes word frequency, identifying the most common words used in the program description. This analysis offers additional context and understanding of the key themes or topics emphasized in the program overview.

The main objective of the code is to organize the extracted details into a structured format suitable for further analysis or record-keeping. This is achieved by constructing a DataFrame using the pandas library, where each detail is assigned to a specific column.

Finally, the code saves the DataFrame containing the extracted details to an Excel file named "degree_details.xlsx". This Excel file serves as a comprehensive repository of program information, facilitating easy access, sharing, and further analysis by stakeholders involved in educational program management or research endeavors.
